## Question
1. Create a class Employee with method work() printing "Employee working".

Create subclass Manager overriding work() to print "Manager managing" and adding method manageTeam() printing "Managing team".

In Main:
* Assign a Manager object to an Employee reference.
* Call work() on that reference (demonstrating dynamic method dispatch).
