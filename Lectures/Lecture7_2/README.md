## Question
2. Create a class Animal with method makeSound() printing "Animal making sound".

Create subclass Dog overriding makeSound() to print "Dog barking" and adding method fetch() printing "Fetching ball".

In Main:
* Assign a Dog object to an Animal reference.
* Call makeSound() on that reference (demonstrating dynamic methodÂ dispatch).
