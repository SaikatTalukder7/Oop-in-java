## Question
1. Create a base class called Pet with the following:

Fields: String pet_name, int age
Method: int displayInfo(), which displays the name and age

Then, create two subclasses:
Dog – has an additional method void bark() that prints "Woof!"
Cat – has an additional method void meow() that prints "Meow!"

Test in main:
